Learned about text preprocessing, supervised learning, and model evaluation‚Äîall while having fun!  \n[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/kirtigupta1219/Sentiment-Analysis)  \n\n---\n\n### 3. üé≤ Multiplayer Ludo Game (Python, Teaching Project)  \nGuided students in building a server-client multiplayer Ludo game. Taught networking, socket programming, and game logic for turn-based fun.  \n[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/kirtigupta1219/Python-Multiplayer-Ludo-Game)  \n\n---\n\n### 4. üìö Book App ‚Äì React Native (Play Store Project)  \nHelped a student create a mobile book browsing app in React Native, now live on Play Store. Students learned UI, navigation, and app deployment.  \n[Try it on Android](https://snack.expo.dev/@kirtigupta02458/book-app?platform=android)  \n\n---\n\n### 5. üõ∞Ô∏è ISS Tracker ‚Äì React Native (Teaching Project)  \nBuilt an app to track the International Space Station in real-time. Students learned API integration and interactive app design.  \n[Interact Here](https://snack.expo.dev/@kirtigupta02458/iss-tracker)  \n\n---\n\n### 6. üî´ 3D Shooting Game (A-Frame, GitHub Project)  \nCreated a first-person 3D shooting game using A-Frame. Learned 3D modeling, physics, and interactivity in VR environments.  \n[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/kirtigupta1219/3D-Shooting-Game)  \n\n---\n\n### 7. ‚è∞ Invisible Cloak (Python, GitHub Project)  \nA Python project that creates an invisibility effect using your webcam. When a red cloth is held up, it appears as if you vanish from the camera view, demonstrating real-time video processing and color masking techniques.  \n[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/kirtigupta1219/Invisible-Clock)  \n\n---\n\n### 8. ‚å®Ô∏è Virtual Keyboard & Mouse (Python, GitHub Project)  \nSimulated keyboard and mouse using computer vision. Students explored image processing, Python libraries, and innovative interaction techniques.  \n[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/kirtigupta1219/Virtual-Keyboard-Mouse)  \n\n---\n\n### 9. ‚öõÔ∏è AR Chemical Bond (AR, Teaching Project)  \nCreated an AR tool to visualize chemical bonds. Students interact with molecules in 3D, making chemistry lessons immersive and fun.  \n[GitHub Repo](https://github.com/kirtigupta1219/AR-Chemical-Bond)  \n\n---\n\n### 10. üèãÔ∏è BMI Calculator (Python, GitHub Project)  \nDeveloped a Body Mass Index calculator in Python.
