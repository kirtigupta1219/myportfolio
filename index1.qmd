  <h1>Hi, I'm Kirti</h1>
  <p>MBA candidate at **University Canada West** and Assistant Center Director at Mathnasium West Vancouver</p>
</div>


  
By December 2025, Iâ€™ll have completed my MBA with electives in **Machine Learning Models and Techniques**, **Cloud Computing Technologies**, and **AI in Business**, all tools Iâ€™m eager to bring into real-world projects.

## ðŸ’¼ What I Do
At Mathnasium, I run daily operations, mentor a team of instructors, and make sure every studentâ€™s learning plan feels tailor-made. I bring a mix of **teaching expertise**, **analytical thinking**, and **leadership skills** to the table, plus a healthy dose of curiosity that keeps me learning new tech every chance I get.

---

## ðŸš€ Where Iâ€™m Headed
Iâ€™m passionate about **programming** and see myself either teaching it, building educational technology solutions, or contributing to IT projects that make learning smarter and more accessible.  
If it blends **code, creativity, and impact**, Iâ€™m in.

## ðŸŒŸ My Mission
Learning should never feel like a chore. My mission is to combine **data-driven insights** with **creative problem-solving** to design learning experiences that actually stick, and maybe even make people smile along the way.

## ðŸŽ¨ Beyond the MBA
When Iâ€™m not managing a learning center or tinkering with code, youâ€™ll probably find me sketching.  
You can see some of my work here: [Instagram Art Page](https://www.instagram.com/ske_tchaholic/?igsh=MTVzb3hkeHczYm52aA%3D%3D&utm_source=qr#)  
I also enjoy mentoring students, volunteering in education projects, and finding ways to use tech for social good.
